Starting from main(),
	a player_rect is created. A pin_rect is NOT created here because the pin surface changes with each level. The player surface remains the same.
	State variables to keep track of the game
	Enter game loop:
		show the menu screen (Press space to start)
		in the event loop:
			- we check if the space key was pressed. If it was, set start game to true. To do any action relating to the game itself, we must first
			check if start game is true.
			- we also handle movements
	check_boundary() to make sure player_rect stays in the game window

	if game_active and start_game:
		show the background
		check if the current level > number of levels.
			if it's greater, that means user has passed level 6.
			**we probably need more things here**
		else
			initialize the levels screen by calling level_init()
				This function creates the pin_rect based on the current level and returns it so we can check for collisions
				This function also handles displaying level num, and any information that should be displayed in the black spaces
